# **Installation: Famous 5-minute install**  
1. Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
2. Open <ins>wp-admin/install.php</ins> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a wp-config.php file with your database connection details.  

      1. If for some reason this doesn’t work, don’t worry. It doesn’t work on all web hosts. Open up wp-config-sample.php with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.

      2. Save the file as wp-config.php and upload it.
      3. Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser.
3. Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your site. If there is an error, double check your wp-config.php file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the WordPress support forums with as much data as you can gather.
4. If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you. If you did not provide a username, it will be admin.
5. The installer should then send you to the login page. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on “Profile” to change the password.
