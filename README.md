# **Installation: Famous 5-minute install**  
1. Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
2. Open <ins>wp-admin/install.php</ins> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a wp-config.php file with your database connection details.  

      1. If for some reason this doesn’t work, don’t worry. It doesn’t work on all web hosts. Open up wp-config-sample.php with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.

      2. Save the file as wp-config.php and upload it.
      3. Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser.
